    <p>The digital footprint is the trail of data that is left behind when one is online. It includes information about a person's online activity, such as their online behavior, websites and applications they visit, and personal information such as emails and phone numbers. The digital footprint can be used to identify individuals or groups who have been affected by online harassment or bullying, and to track their online activities and behaviors. It can also be used to identify potential online predators and to prevent them from gaining unauthorized access to personal information. </p>
